## Prerequisites

You will need Python (>= 3.5), ScummVM (>= 2.0.0) and inotify-tools.

    $ sudo dnf install scummvm inotify-tools

#### OpenSUSE

    $ sudo zypper install scummvm inotify-tools

#### Debian, Ubuntu et consortes

    $ sudo apt install scummvm inotify-tools

#### Arch, Manjaro

    $ sudo pacman -S scummvm inotify-tools


## Installation (using tarball)

1. Close Steam.
2. Download and unpack tarball to `compatibilitytools.d` directory (create one if it does not exist):

       $ cd ~/.local/share/Steam/compatibilitytools.d/ || cd ~/.steam/root/compatibilitytools.d/
       $ curl -L https://github.com/dreamer/roberta/releases/download/v0.1.0/roberta.tar.xz | tar xJf -

3. Start Steam.
4. In game properties window select "Force the use of a specific Steam Play
   compatibility tool" and select "Roberta (native ScummVM)".


## Installation (from source)

1. Close Steam.
2. Clone the repository and install the script to user directory:

       $ git clone https://github.com/dreamer/roberta.git
       $ cd roberta
       $ make user-install

3. Start Steam.
4. In game properties window select "Force the use of a specific Steam Play
   compatibility tool" and select "Roberta (dev)".


## Configuration

Settings for Roberta can be found in `~/.config/roberta.conf` (or wherever
[`XDG_CONFIG_HOME`](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html)
points to).

Additionally, per-game settings can be changed through variables set in the
Steam client.  For example, to force game to use your **secondary** screen,
right-click your game in Steam Library, select
*Properties&nbsp;&nbsp;General&nbsp;â†’&nbsp;Launch&nbsp;Options*
and set: `LUX_USE_SCREEN=1 %command%`.

You can use `LUX_SCUMMVM_GAME=<game-identifier>` to bypass the ScummVM
launcher menu, and start the game right away, but it will hide important
ScummVM launcher options.  To open launcher menu press **Ctrl+F5** and
select **Return to Launcher**.  The *game-identifier* value is one of
section names in `roberta_scummvm.ini` file in the game installation directory.

| Name               | Values  | Description
|:---                |:---     |:---
| `LUX_SCUMMVM_GAME` | string  | Set to the game identifier to run the specific game in a collection, bypassing the ScummVM launcher menu.
| `LUX_SCUMMVM_CMD`  | command | Use this command to run the game. Overrides value in `scummvm.cmd` setting.
| `LUX_USE_SCREEN`   | number  | Set to the number of the screen, that you want the game to use. Overrides `scummvm.fullscreenmode` setting.
